# Risk-Assessment-Tool

Automated risk assessment voting tool and dashboard built using Excel VBA.
This tool was built to reduce costs (i.e. instead of purchasing an off-the-shelf risk assessment tool).
For use during risk assessment sessions to collate risk impact and likelihood assessments from session participants.
Results are displayed in real-time on a dashboard.
Results are also saved in text files and sent by email to the session administrator.
